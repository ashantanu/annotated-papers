# annotated-papers

Inspired by [Akash's Repo](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/annotated_research_papers), I have started my own collection of annotated research papers.

I started annotating as a part of my reading assignments duing my MS at UMass Amherst. I followed a color scheme relevant to the assignment which I will continue to follow.


Please leave feedback and let me know any mistakes in my annotations!
